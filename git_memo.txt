<STASH>
Stash sequence
1. stash save "message"
2. stash list
3. stash apply <stash_id in the list>
4. stash drop (if you want to delete stash)
5. stash pop (apply and drop in one step)
6. checkout -- . (clean up files like a last commit status)

<REMOVE>
1. git rm <file_name> (you should use this rather than rm)
2. rm (only for untracked files, not use this for unstaged files)
